# Introduction to Python for Cognitive Science

Welcome to your first lesson in Python programming for Cognitive Science! This course is designed specifically for students exploring the intersection of cognitive science and computational methods.

## Why Python for Cognitive Science?

Python has become the language of choice for research in cognitive science and artificial intelligence for several reasons:

- **Readability**: Python's clean syntax makes it accessible to researchers from diverse backgrounds
- **Rich ecosystem**: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn provide powerful tools for data analysis
- **Functional programming capabilities**: Python supports functional programming paradigms that are particularly useful in computational modeling
- **Extensive adoption**: Most cognitive science and machine learning research is conducted using Python

As cognitive scientists, you'll use Python to model cognitive processes, analyze experimental data, and build AI systems that help us understand the human mind.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Let's get started by setting up a Python environment:

```python
# Check your Python version
import sys
print(sys.version)

# Import some common libraries we'll use throughout the course
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Your first Python code - a simple cognitive science example
reaction_times = [350, 320, 380, 290, 310, 360, 330, 380, 290, 310]
average_rt = sum(reaction_times) / len(reaction_times)
print(f"Average reaction time: {average_rt} ms")
```

## Introduction to Functional Programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. This approach is particularly valuable in cognitive science because:

1. **Reproducibility**: Pure functions always produce the same output for the same input
2. **Parallelization**: Functions without side effects can be executed in parallel
3. **Testability**: Pure functions are easier to test and debug
4. **Modularity**: Functions can be composed to build complex systems from simple components

Python supports functional programming concepts through:

- First-class functions (functions as variables)
- Lambda expressions (anonymous functions)
- Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)
- List comprehensions

Let's look at a simple example of functional programming in Python that's relevant to cognitive science:

```python
# Imperative approach (traditional)
def calculate_z_scores_imperative(data):
    result = []
    mean = sum(data) / len(data)
    std_dev = (sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5
    for value in data:
        z_score = (value - mean) / std_dev
        result.append(z_score)
    return result

# Functional approach
def calculate_z_scores_functional(data):
    mean = sum(data) / len(data)
    std_dev = (sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5
    return list(map(lambda x: (x - mean) / std_dev, data))

# Data from a hypothetical cognitive experiment (reaction times in ms)
reaction_times = [350, 320, 380, 290, 310, 360, 330, 380, 290, 310]

# Both approaches give the same result
print(calculate_z_scores_imperative(reaction_times))
print(calculate_z_scores_functional(reaction_times))
```

## Exercise: Your First Python Program

Let's write a simple program to analyze some cognitive science data:

1. Create a list of reaction times from an experiment
2. Calculate the mean and standard deviation
3. Identify outliers (values more than 2 standard deviations from the mean)
4. Plot the results using matplotlib

This exercise will help you get comfortable with Python syntax while working with data relevant to cognitive science.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into functional programming concepts and explore how they can be applied to cognitive modeling. We'll learn about:

- Pure functions and immutability
- Higher-order functions in depth
- Function composition
- Recursion as an alternative to loops

By mastering these concepts, you'll build a strong foundation for more advanced topics like data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning which we'll cover in future lessons.

Remember, programming is a skill that improves with practice. Try to apply what you've learned to your own cognitive science questions or research interests.
