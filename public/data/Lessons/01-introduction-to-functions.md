# Python Functions Explained Through Coffee Shop Operations

**Learning Objective**: Understand how to create and use functions in Python by simulating a coffee shop workflow.

---

## 1. What Are Functions? (The Coffee Machine Blueprint)

A function is a reusable set of instructions that performs a specific task. Think of it like a coffee machine:

```python  
# Function definition (machine blueprint)  
def brew_coffee(coffee_type):  
    """Brews a specific coffee drink"""  
    print(f"Grinding beans for {coffee_type}")  
    print(f"Brewing {coffee_type}...")  
    return f"Your {coffee_type} is ready!"  

# Using the function (placing an order)  
order_result = brew_coffee("latte")  
print(order_result)  
```

**Key Concepts**:

- **`def`**: Defines the function (like installing a coffee machine)
- **Parameters**: Input slots (`coffee_type` = drink selection)
- **Function Body**: Actions to perform (grinding, brewing steps)
- **`return`**: Final output (serving the drink)

**Why This Matters**:
Functions help avoid repeating code. Just like a coffee machine standardizes drink preparation, functions standardize common tasks.

---

## 2. Parameters vs. Arguments: Custom Orders

**Parameters** are variables listed in the function definition. **Arguments** are actual values passed during a function call.

```python  
def take_order(drink, size, milk_type="whole"):  
    """Processes a coffee order with customizations"""  
    price = 3.00  
    if size == "large":  
        price += 1.50  
    if milk_type != "whole":  
        price += 0.50  
    return f"{size} {drink} with {milk_type} milk: ${price}"  

# Using different arguments  
print(take_order("cappuccino", "medium"))             # Uses default milk  
print(take_order("latte", "large", "almond"))         # Custom milk  
```

**Key Differences**:

- **Parameters**: `drink`, `size`, `milk_type` (defined in function)
- **Arguments**: `"latte"`, `"large"`, `"almond"` (actual values passed)

**Default Values**:
`milk_type="whole"` lets customers skip specifying milk unless they want alternatives.

---

## 3. Return Values: Serving the Finished Product

The `return` statement sends data back from the function. Without it, functions don't provide usable results.

```python  
def calculate_serving_time(orders):  
    """Calculates total wait time"""  
    return orders * 2.5  # 2.5 minutes per order  

# Compare these two approaches:  
def bad_service(orders):  
    print(f"Wait time: {orders * 2.5} minutes")  

good_result = calculate_serving_time(3)  # Returns 7.5  
bad_result = bad_service(3)              # Returns None  

print(f"Good result: {good_result}")  
print(f"Bad result: {bad_result}")  
```

**Critical Insight**:

- Use `return` to get *usable data* from functions
- `print()` only *displays* information â€“ it doesn't return data for later use

## Code-Along Exercises

### Exercise 1: Price Calculator

```python  
def calculate_price(base_price, size):  
    """Calculates final price based on size"""  
    size_multiplier = {  
        "small": 1.0,  
        "medium": 1.3,  
        "large": 1.6  
    }  
    return base_price * size_multiplier[size]  

# Test the function  
print(f"Medium coffee: ${calculate_price(3.00, 'medium'):.2f}")  
print(f"Large coffee: ${calculate_price(3.00, 'large'):.2f}")  
```


### Exercise 2: Order Validator

```python  
def is_valid_order(drink, size):  
    """Checks if the order is possible"""  
    valid_drinks = ["espresso", "latte", "cappuccino"]  
    valid_sizes = ["small", "medium", "large"]  
    return drink in valid_drinks and size in valid_sizes  

# Test cases  
print(is_valid_order("mocha", "large"))  # False (invalid drink)  
print(is_valid_order("latte", "tall"))   # False (invalid size)  
print(is_valid_order("espresso", "small"))  # True  
```

---

## Group Work: Complete Order System

```python  
order_log = []  # Tracks all orders  

def process_order(customer, drink, size):  
    """Handles full order workflow"""  
    if not is_valid_order(drink, size):  
        return "Invalid order - please check menu"  
    order_details = {  
        "customer": customer,  
        "drink": drink,  
        "size": size  
    }  
    order_log.append(order_details)  
    return f"{customer}'s {size} {drink} entered into system!"  

# Team Tasks  
# 1. Process these orders:  
print(process_order("Maria", "latte", "medium"))  
print(process_order("Luca", "frappuccino", "large"))  # Invalid  

# 2. Display order log:  
print("\nOrder History:")  
for order in order_log:  
    print(f"{order['customer']}: {order['size']} {order['drink']}")  
```

**What You'll Learn**:

1. How functions work together
2. Using return values to control workflow
3. Storing data in lists for later use

## Common Mistakes \& Fixes

### Mistake 1: Forgetting Parentheses

```python  
def make_espresso  
    # Missing colon and parentheses  
    print("Making espresso...")  

# Fixed version  
def make_espresso():  
    print("Making espresso...")  
```


### Mistake 2: Ignoring Return Values

```python  
def get_bean_count():  
    beans = 15  

# This returns None!  
bean_amount = get_bean_count()  

# Fixed version  
def get_bean_count():  
    return 15  
```


### Mistake 3: Parameter Mismatch

```python  
def serve_drink(drink, size):  
    print(f"Serving {size} {drink}")  

serve_drink("large")  # Missing argument!  

# Fixed version  
serve_drink("latte", "large")  
```

## Advanced Concept: Tracking Prep Times

```python  
def process_order_v2(customer, drink, size):  
    """Advanced version with prep tracking"""  
    prep_times = {  
        "espresso": 2.0,  
        "latte": 3.5,  
        "cappuccino": 4.0  
    }  
    order_details = {  
        "customer": customer,  
        "prep_time": prep_times[drink] * (1.5 if size == "large" else 1)  
    }  
    return order_details  

# Example usage  
order = process_order_v2("Sophia", "latte", "large")  
print(f"Prep time: {order['prep_time']} minutes")  
```

## Open-Ended Coding Challenges

### Challenge 1: Coffee Shop Inventory System

**Task**: Create a system that tracks coffee bean inventory as drinks are ordered.

**Requirements**:
- Create functions to:
  - Add new coffee beans to inventory
  - Remove beans when drinks are made (different drinks use different amounts)
  - Alert when inventory is low
- Implement at least one default parameter
- Use return values to track current inventory levels

**Example starter code**:
```python
# You'll need to expand this significantly
inventory = {"arabica": 500, "robusta": 350, "decaf": 200}  # grams

def make_coffee(coffee_type, size):
    # How much coffee does this drink use?
    # How should inventory be updated?
    # What should happen if inventory is too low?
    pass
```

### Challenge 2: Barista Efficiency Simulator

**Task**: Model a cafe with multiple baristas and customer orders.

**Requirements**:
- Create a function to assign orders to baristas based on their current workload
- Track how long each barista takes to complete orders
- Calculate and return statistics like average wait time
- Use nested functions and/or function composition
- Implement a way to handle rush hour (many orders at once)

**Example starter code**:
```python
baristas = {
    "Alex": {"orders": [], "speed_factor": 1.0},
    "Jamie": {"orders": [], "speed_factor": 1.2},
    "Casey": {"orders": [], "speed_factor": 0.9}
}

def assign_order(drink, size, customer_name):
    # Which barista should make this drink?
    # How do you track current workload?
    pass

def simulate_cafe_day(order_list):
    # Process a full day of orders
    # Calculate efficiency metrics
    pass
```

### Challenge 3: Coffee Shop Business Analytics

**Task**: Create a comprehensive reporting system that analyzes the coffee shop's performance.

**Requirements**:
- Implement functions that:
  - Analyze sales data to find the most popular drinks and sizes
  - Calculate revenue and profit (different drinks have different costs and prices)
  - Identify peak ordering times
  - Generate a summary report
- Process data using function composition (the output of one function becomes input to another)
- Include data visualization instructions (textual description of what charts to create)
- Use at least one function with a variable number of arguments

**Example starter code**:
```python
daily_orders = [
    {"time": "08:24", "drink": "espresso", "size": "small", "price": 2.50, "cost": 0.90},
    {"time": "08:35", "drink": "latte", "size": "large", "price": 4.50, "cost": 1.80},
    # ... many more orders
]

def analyze_popular_items(orders, *categories):
    # Find the most frequently ordered items
    # categories might be "drink", "size", or both
    pass

def calculate_financials(orders):
    # Calculate total revenue, costs, profit
    pass

def generate_report(orders, include_profits=True, include_popular=True):
    # Create a comprehensive report
    # Call other analytical functions as needed
    pass
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Functions Are Recipes**:
    - Define steps once (`def`), reuse with different inputs
    - Like standardizing how you make lattes vs cappuccinos
2. **Parameters Customize Behavior**:
    - Act like order customization options
    - Default values simplify common cases
3. **Return Values Are Essential**:
    - Provide actual data for later use
    - Without returns, functions just perform actions without results
