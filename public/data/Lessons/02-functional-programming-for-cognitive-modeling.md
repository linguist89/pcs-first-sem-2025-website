# Functional Programming for Cognitive Modeling

Welcome to the second lesson in our series on Python for Cognitive Science! Having covered the basics of Python and introduced functional programming concepts, we'll now dive deeper into how functional programming can be applied to cognitive modeling.

## Pure Functions in Cognitive Science

Pure functions are the cornerstone of functional programming. A pure function:
1. Always returns the same output for the same input
2. Has no side effects (doesn't modify external state)
3. Doesn't depend on external state

These properties make pure functions ideal for cognitive modeling, where reproducibility and transparency are crucial. Let's examine a cognitive science application:

```python
# Impure function (depends on external state)
threshold = 0.7
def decision_model_impure(evidence):
    if evidence > threshold:  # Uses global variable
        return "Accept"
    else:
        return "Reject"

# Pure function (all dependencies explicit)
def decision_model_pure(evidence, threshold):
    if evidence > threshold:
        return "Accept"
    else:
        return "Reject"
    
# The pure function is more flexible and testable
print(decision_model_pure(0.8, 0.7))  # "Accept"
print(decision_model_pure(0.8, 0.9))  # "Reject"
```

## Higher-Order Functions for Data Transformation

Higher-order functions - functions that take other functions as arguments or return them - are powerful tools for data manipulation. In cognitive science research, we often need to apply the same transformation to multiple datasets or compare different models on the same data.

The three most common higher-order functions in Python are:
- `map()`: Apply a function to each item in an iterable
- `filter()`: Select items from an iterable based on a function
- `reduce()`: Aggregate items in an iterable to a single value

Let's see how these can be applied to cognitive science data:

```python
from functools import reduce

# Sample reaction time data from multiple participants
participant_data = [
    [342, 337, 331, 325, 329, 338, 345],  # Participant 1
    [401, 415, 390, 366, 405, 400, 422],  # Participant 2
    [290, 310, 301, 285, 296, 314, 287]   # Participant 3
]

# Using map to calculate mean reaction time for each participant
mean_rts = list(map(lambda data: sum(data) / len(data), participant_data))
print(f"Mean reaction times: {mean_rts}")

# Using filter to identify fast responders (mean RT < 350ms)
fast_responders = list(filter(lambda mean: mean < 350, mean_rts))
print(f"Number of fast responders: {len(fast_responders)}")

# Using reduce to find the overall average across all participants
all_rts = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, participant_data)
overall_mean = sum(all_rts) / len(all_rts)
print(f"Overall mean reaction time: {overall_mean:.2f} ms")
```

## Function Composition and Pipelines

Function composition involves chaining functions together so that the output of one function becomes the input of another. This is a powerful way to build data processing pipelines for cognitive science research:

```python
# Define individual processing steps as pure functions
def remove_outliers(data, threshold=2.5):
    """Remove reaction times that are more than threshold SDs from the mean"""
    mean = sum(data) / len(data)
    std = (sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5
    return [x for x in data if abs((x - mean) / std) <= threshold]

def normalize(data):
    """Z-score normalization"""
    mean = sum(data) / len(data)
    std = (sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / len(data)) ** 0.5
    return [(x - mean) / std for x in data]

def exclude_negative_values(data):
    """Filter out negative values (e.g., implausible RTs)"""
    return [x for x in data if x >= 0]

# Function composition using a pipeline approach
def process_reaction_times(data):
    clean_data = remove_outliers(data)
    normalized_data = normalize(clean_data)
    valid_data = exclude_negative_values(normalized_data)
    return valid_data

# Example usage
raw_reaction_times = [342, 337, 531, 125, 329, 338, 145, 210, 990]
processed_data = process_reaction_times(raw_reaction_times)
print(f"Processed data: {processed_data}")
```

## Building a Cognitive Model with Functional Programming

Let's apply functional programming to build a simple cognitive model. We'll implement a drift diffusion model, which is commonly used to model decision-making processes in cognitive science:

```python
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def drift_diffusion_trial(drift_rate, threshold, noise_sd, max_steps=1000):
    """
    Simulate a single trial of the drift diffusion model
    
    Parameters:
    - drift_rate: Rate of evidence accumulation (higher = faster decisions)
    - threshold: Decision boundary (higher = more conservative)
    - noise_sd: Standard deviation of noise (higher = more variable)
    - max_steps: Maximum time steps to simulate
    
    Returns:
    - decision: 1 (upper threshold) or -1 (lower threshold)
    - reaction_time: Number of steps until decision
    - evidence_path: The path of evidence accumulation
    """
    evidence = 0
    evidence_path = [evidence]
    
    for step in range(max_steps):
        # Add noise to the drift rate (Gaussian noise)
        noise = random.gauss(0, noise_sd)
        evidence += drift_rate + noise
        evidence_path.append(evidence)
        
        # Check if a threshold has been reached
        if evidence >= threshold:
            return 1, step + 1, evidence_path
        elif evidence <= -threshold:
            return -1, step + 1, evidence_path
    
    # If max steps reached without decision
    return 0, max_steps, evidence_path

# Run multiple trials with the same parameters
def simulate_experiment(n_trials, drift_rate, threshold, noise_sd):
    """Run multiple trials of the drift diffusion model"""
    trial_simulator = lambda: drift_diffusion_trial(drift_rate, threshold, noise_sd)
    return [trial_simulator() for _ in range(n_trials)]

# Analyze results (using functional approach)
def analyze_results(experiment_data):
    # Extract decisions and reaction times
    decisions, rts, _ = zip(*experiment_data)
    
    # Count frequency of each decision
    decision_counts = {
        "upper": sum(1 for d in decisions if d == 1),
        "lower": sum(1 for d in decisions if d == -1),
        "timeout": sum(1 for d in decisions if d == 0)
    }
    
    # Calculate mean RT for each decision type
    upper_rts = [rt for d, rt, _ in experiment_data if d == 1]
    lower_rts = [rt for d, rt, _ in experiment_data if d == -1]
    
    mean_rts = {
        "upper": sum(upper_rts) / len(upper_rts) if upper_rts else 0,
        "lower": sum(lower_rts) / len(lower_rts) if lower_rts else 0
    }
    
    return {
        "decision_counts": decision_counts,
        "mean_rts": mean_rts
    }

# Experiment parameters
params = {
    "easy_task": {"drift_rate": 0.1, "threshold": 2.0, "noise_sd": 0.3},
    "hard_task": {"drift_rate": 0.05, "threshold": 2.0, "noise_sd": 0.3}
}

# Run experiments
experiments = {
    condition: simulate_experiment(50, **params) 
    for condition, params in params.items()
}

# Analyze and print results
results = {
    condition: analyze_results(data) 
    for condition, data in experiments.items()
}

print("Experiment Results:")
for condition, result in results.items():
    print(f"\n{condition.upper()}")
    print(f"Decision counts: {result['decision_counts']}")
    print(f"Mean reaction times: {result['mean_rts']}")
    
# Visualize a sample trial
_, _, evidence_path = experiments["easy_task"][0]
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))
plt.plot(evidence_path)
plt.axhline(y=params["easy_task"]["threshold"], color='r', linestyle='-', label="Upper Threshold")
plt.axhline(y=-params["easy_task"]["threshold"], color='g', linestyle='-', label="Lower Threshold")
plt.title("Evidence Accumulation in Drift Diffusion Model")
plt.xlabel("Time Steps")
plt.ylabel("Evidence")
plt.legend()
```

## Exercise: Extending the Cognitive Model

For practice, try extending our drift diffusion model in the following ways:

1. Add a parameter for "bias" that shifts the starting point of evidence accumulation
2. Implement a function to fit the model parameters to experimental data
3. Compare the model's predictions for different parameter settings

## Key Takeaways

In this lesson, we've seen how functional programming concepts can be applied to cognitive science:

1. **Pure functions** ensure reproducibility in cognitive models
2. **Higher-order functions** simplify data transformation pipelines
3. **Function composition** creates clean, modular cognitive models
4. **Immutability** helps prevent bugs in complex simulations

By adopting a functional programming approach, your cognitive models will be:
- More readable and maintainable
- Easier to test and debug
- More scalable to larger datasets
- Better suited for parallel processing

In our next lesson, we'll explore how to use these functional programming concepts with libraries like NumPy and Pandas to analyze real cognitive science datasets efficiently.
